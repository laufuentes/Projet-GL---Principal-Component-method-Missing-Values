### Laura Fuentes and Ambre Adjevi

Welcome to our project repository for the course "Guidelines in Statistical Learning"! We are Laura Fuentes and Ambre Adjevi, M2 students in Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence at Paris-Saclay University. For our final project, we've focused on the paper titled "A Principal Components Method to Impute Missing Values for Mixed Data" [1].

We've provided a comprehensive report summarizing the paper and have implemented the algorithms introduced in the article. Our implementation allows testing the algorithm's properties on both synthetic and real datasets [2].

When a dataset contains missing values, traditional statistical learning methods cannot be directly applied. Imputation, which involves substituting artificial values for the missing ones, addresses this issue by rendering datasets complete and analyzable. While techniques exist for imputing continuous or categorical data, when dealing with mixed data, these methods become inapplicable. Thus, there is a need to develop techniques specifically tailored to mixed data, contributing to the expanding literature on this subject. The authors propose an iterative imputation algorithm based on the Factorial Analysis for Mixed Data (FAMD) technique.
